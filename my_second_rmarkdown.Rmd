```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE)
```

# This is a main heading

## a subsection

### sub-sub section

#### another low level heading

##### 5 hashtags

This is text in the document. We write just like we do in Word (or Google Docs).  

To create a new line we need to
include two
spaces.  
This should be a new line.  

###### 6 hashtags

Some more text.  

## Code in RMarkdown

This is a sentence that will include in-line code by adding 2 + 2 = `r 2 + 2`.  

### code chunks

```{r}
# this is a comment

## here's another comment

### NOT a section header
```

Place another code chunk below.  

```{r, eval=TRUE}
str(iris)
```

Here's an example code chunk with an incomplete line of code.  

```{r, eval=TRUE}
x <- 3.1
```

Add 2 to the variable `x`.  

```{r}
x + 2
```
